# GitHub workshop - Solana Group

## Overview of key terms 

- **fork** a GitHub repository -> copy a collaborator’s repository to your own GitHub account
- **clone** it locally -> copy the repository/file to your computer while maintaining a connection to your remote (GitHub) version
- create a new file locally and **commit** it to your local repository -> save the file locally in your version control system
- **push** your changes to your GitHub version -> synchronise your local changes with your remote repository
- contribute a file to the original repository by making a **pull request** -> request your collaborator, the owner of the original repository, to fetch your proposed changes and merge them into the original repository
- **pull the upstream repository into your fork** -> update your fork to reflect all the changes that happened in your collaborator’s original repository
